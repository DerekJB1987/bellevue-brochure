            <div class="section1">
                <p>Bellevue is a city in Western Washington located 10 miles east of Seattle. Bellevue promotes itself as a diverse city and the heart of the Eastside that is home to 
                    dozens of innovative technology companies. Bellevue was settled in 1869 by William Meydenbauer and Aaron Mercer to claimed homestead tracts several miles apart. It was used 
                    primarily as a rural area with little development prior to the construction of the Lake Washington Floating Bridge in 1940. According to the United States Census Nureeau, the city 
                    has a total of 36.47 square miles. The city's name is derived from a French term for "beautiful view". It resides between Lake Washington to the west and Lake Washington to the east.

                    business district located along the eastern shore of Lake Washington. Overlake straddles the eastern part of Bellevue and southern Redmond thus creating its' own
                    unique identity. Crossroards is a neighborhood located in the north and eastern portion of the city that is a mix-use of residential and shopping with a non-white majority population.
                    Lakes Hills lies to the south of Crossroads and is largely a residential community and the Eastgate neighborhood lies directly south of Lake Hills and Downtown Bellevue is 
                    also nearly completely residential.</p>
