                dozens of innovative technology companies. Bellevue was settled in 1869 by William Meydenbauer and Aaron Mercer to claimed homestead tracts several miles apart. It was used 
                primarily as a rural area with little development prior to the construction of the Lake Washington Floating Bridge in 1940. According to the United States Census Nureeau, the city 
                has a total of 36.47 square miles. The city's name is derived from a French term for "beautiful view". It resides between Lake Washington to the west and Lake Washington to the east.
