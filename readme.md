# bellevue-brochure
A three-page site of Bellevue, WA that reinforces HTML and CSS basics taught in the book
**A Smarter Way to Learn HTML & CSS** by Mark Myers. 

The final project consisted of creating a three-page site for my home city, local region or country. All the information
I used can be found on Wikipedia, and https://bellevuewa.gov/. All information that is presented on the Things to Do page
can be found in depth on the specific homepages for each locale.

### Technical Elements
The HTML elements used on this simple brochure are a proper Meta desrciption, divs used to distinguish key sections in the body and unordered lists to create the main navbar at the top, the sidebar located on the right side of the page and the footer on the bottom of the page. Anchor tags, paragraph tags and different sized headings are used in each page. There are also image tags used on the shopping.html and things-to-do.html page. 

The CSS stylesheet shows the timeline of of each HTML element used to build my practice site and basic CSS styling to create
the look seen in my final product.
